		Particle Play is an open sandbox game that allows you to draw various particles of sand, water, stone, fire, etc., and watch them react on the screen with gravity, temperature, and each other.<br /> 
		<h2>The Toolbox</h2>

		The Toolbox is a sliding drawer at the bottom of your sandbox. Here you will find all tools available to you for playing in the sandbox. You can open the toolbox by clicking on the blue toolbox bar at the bottom of your screen, or by sliding it up.<br /><br />
		<h3>Set Particle & Brush Size</h3>
		<img src="brushslider.png"><br />Click on the particle icon in your toolbox to choose your particle. Adjust the slider next to the icon to indicate your desired brush size.<br />
		<h3>Set Ambient Temperature</h3>
		<img src="tempslider.png"><br />Adjust the temperature slider to set the overall ambient temperature in your sandbox. Doing so will cause different reactions with the particles. For example freezing temperatures will cause water to freeze and lava to cool rapidly. Scorching temperatures will cause gunpowder to explode, plants to combust, and water will turn to steam.<br />
		<h3>Erase Particles</h3>
